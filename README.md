# AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian Agriculture with EDA

## üìå Project Overview
**AgriData Explorer** is a data analysis and visualization project focused on understanding crop production, yields, and farming areas across India. Using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, the project integrates district-level agricultural data from the ICRISAT dataset to provide actionable insights for **farmers**, **policymakers**, and **researchers**.

The goal is to enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by exploring historical and regional agricultural performance.

## üéØ Problem Statement
India's agricultural sector is vital to the economy, yet agricultural data remains **complex, fragmented, and difficult to access**. This project creates an **interactive data visualization platform** that:
- Integrates state and district-level data.
- Offers insights into crop production, yields, and cultivation areas.
- Helps stakeholders identify **trends, gaps, and disparities**.
- Supports decision-making for crop optimization, resource allocation, and research.

## üíº Business Use Cases

### **Farmers**
- Analyze historical crop performance to choose optimal crops per season.
- Identify productivity gaps and improve practices like irrigation and soil health.

### **Policymakers**
- Detect low-productivity regions for targeted subsidies or resources.
- Track fluctuating yields to improve crop insurance and risk policies.

### **Researchers**
- Study the impact of climate, soil, and irrigation on yields.
- Identify opportunities for innovation (e.g., high-yielding varieties).

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

### **1. Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Data from **ICRISAT-District Level Data** and official reports.
- Standardized units, handled missing values, ensured consistency.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified top-performing states & districts for major crops.
- Analyzed trends over 50 years for rice, wheat, sugarcane, and more.
- Compared crop yields across regions.

### **3. Visualization**
- Built **Python-based** EDA plots (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly).
- Developed **Power BI dashboards** with interactive filters and KPIs.
- Created **geospatial maps**, time-series graphs, and comparative charts.

### **4. Advanced Analytics**
- Machine learning models for:
  - Yield forecasting.
  - Best cultivation area prediction.
  - Crop diversification recommendations.

## üìä Key EDA Insights
Some of the analyses performed:
- **Top 7 Rice Producing States** (bar plot).
- **Top 5 Wheat Producing States** & % share (bar + pie chart).
- **Oilseed & Sunflower Production Leaders**.
- **50-year trends** in sugarcane, millet, and sorghum production.
- **Rice vs. Wheat yield comparison**.
- **District-level deep dives** (e.g., Rice in West Bengal, Wheat in UP).
- Impact of cultivated area on production for major crops.
